# Generating a Large Random Number File

This script generates a file containing 30 million random unsigned 64-bit integers and writes them to `input-max.txt`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Execution

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

This will generate a file named `input-max.txt` in the same directory as the script, containing 30 million random numbers.

## Notes
- The generated numbers range from `0` to `18,446,744,073,709,551,615`.
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space before executing the script, as the output file will be large.
