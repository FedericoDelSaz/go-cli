# Time and Space Complexity Analysis

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of the program is determined by the following steps:

1. **Reading the file** (`readNumbersFromFile`):

    - The program reads the entire input file line by line and processes each number individually.
    - Assuming there are `M` numbers in the file, this step takes **O(M)** time.

2. **Sorting the numbers** (`sort.Slice`):

    - Sorting an array of `M` numbers takes **O(M log M)** time.

3. **Selecting the top ****`N`**** numbers**:

    - The slicing operation `numbers[:N]` is **O(N)**, which is negligible compared to sorting.

4. **Writing to the output file** (`writeNumbersToFile`):

    - Writing `N` numbers to the output file takes **O(N)** time.

### Overall Time Complexity:

Since sorting dominates the complexity, the overall time complexity is:

O(M) + O(M \log M) + O(N) + O(N) = O(M log M)

If `N` is significantly smaller than `M`, then `O(N)` becomes negligible, and the complexity remains **O(M log M)**.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the storage requirements:

1. **Storage for numbers**:

    - The program stores all `M` numbers in memory, which requires **O(M)** space.

2. **Sorting storage**:

    - The sorting algorithm in Go (`sort.Slice`) operates in-place, so it does not require additional storage beyond `O(M)`.

3. **Output storage**:

    - The program keeps an array of size `N` when writing to the file, which takes **O(N)** additional space.

### Overall Space Complexity:

The dominant factor is the storage of `M` numbers in memory, so the overall space complexity is:

O(M) + O(N) = O(M)

If `N` is much smaller than `M`, then `O(N)` is negligible, and the space complexity remains **O(M)**.

## Summary

| Operation       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Reading input   | O(M)            | O(M)             |
| Sorting         | O(M log M)      | O(1) (in-place)  |
| Selecting top N | O(N)            | O(1)             |
| Writing output  | O(N)            | O(1)             |
| **Total**       | **O(M log M)**  | **O(M)**         |

**NOTE: O(1) (Constant Time Complexity) *** means that the algorithm's execution time or space requirement does not grow as the input size increases.

Thus, the program efficiently processes large input files but requires sufficient memory to hold all numbers during execution.
