# Time and Space Complexity Analysis

## Time Complexity
The program consists of several key operations that contribute to its overall time complexity:

### Reading the file (O(L))
Each line of the file is read once using `bufio.Scanner`, where **L** is the number of lines.

### Parsing numbers (O(L))
Each line is parsed, and conversion to `uint64` is attempted. Since each operation (reading, splitting, and conversion) is constant-time per line, this step remains **O(L)**.

### Sorting the numbers (O(L log L))
The collected numbers are sorted using `sort.Slice`, which has an average complexity of **O(L log L)**, where **L** is the total count of valid numbers.

### Selecting the top N numbers (O(N))
The program slices the sorted list to obtain the top **N** numbers, which takes **O(N)**.

### Writing to the output file (O(N))
Writing the top **N** numbers to the file requires **O(N)** operations.

### Overall Complexity
Since sorting dominates the operations, the overall time complexity is **O(L log L)**.
For cases where **N** is significantly smaller than **L**, we can optimize this further (see the improvements section).

## Space Complexity
- **Storing valid numbers:** The program keeps all valid numbers in memory, which results in **O(L)** space usage.
- **Sorting in-place:** The sorting operation does not require extra space beyond the storage of numbers, maintaining **O(L)** space complexity.
- **Output storage:** The output file does not contribute to in-memory space usage.

Thus, the overall space complexity is **O(L)**.

## Potential Improvements

### Stream Processing to Reduce Memory Usage and performance (O(N))
Instead of storing all numbers, we can process the file line by line, maintaining only the **N** largest numbers in a heap.
This reduces space complexity from **O(L)** to **O(N)**, which is significant for large input files.
